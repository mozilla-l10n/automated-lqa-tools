### Completeness

**18 strings** are not translated yet, concentrated in:

- `mozilla-mobile/fenix/app/src/main/res/values-en-rCA/strings.xml` — 13
- `mozilla-mobile/android-components/components/feature/summarize/src/main/res/values-en-rCA/strings.xml` — 5

_Completeness is reported, never raised as a finding: a missing string needs translating, not fixing._

### Conventions detected in this locale

Counted over the whole tree. Checks flag deviations from the locale's **own** majority, so a convention that reads _mixed_ produces no findings at all.

| Convention | Counts | Inferred |
|---|---|---|
| quotes | `curly-double` 14, `curly-single` 1 | **curly-double** |
| apostrophe | `typographic` 166 | **typographic** |
| ellipsis | `char` 21 | **char** |
| dash | `em` 3 | **em** |

## 4. Appendix

### Dismissed by hand (0)

_Nothing dismissed._

_One line each in `locales/en-CA/dismissed.txt`. Delete the line and the finding returns._

### Suppressed as false positives (0)

_No suppression rules have matched._

### Withdrawn to date (0)

_Nothing withdrawn._

_A finding is withdrawn when a check stops raising it while the string itself never changed: the check was wrong, not the translation. Kept separate from fixes so the fixed count stays honest._

### Fixed to date (1)

- `preference_privacy_block_analytics_summary` — `mozilla-mobile/focus-android/app/src/main/res/values-en-rCA/strings.xml` — fixed 2026-08-21
